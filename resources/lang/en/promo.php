        'about_p'=>'not consider yourself a "website expert", you can tell the difference between a "good website" and a "bad website" pretty easily — it s one of those "you know it when you see it" situations that comes with consuming so much content online. Within the first few seconds of visiting a new website, your brain is analyzing load time, design, navigation, photography and content, while also comparing the experience to previous website experiences.

        And those same split-second considerations you re making when you order pizza for the fiftieth time since the beginning of the pandemic are the same considerations prospective and current families are making when they visit your website. Is this site loading quickly? Is it working well on my mobile device? Can I find what I m looking for? Is this visually appealing?

        2020 brought the importance of your school or district s website into the forefront. If content was hard to find, or the site didn t work well on mobile — you likely heard about it (and hopefully felt compelled to do something about it.) Or even worse, maybe you didn t hear about it. So, as we look ahead to 2021 and 2022 and beyond, the question of "what makes a good school website" has never been more important.',
